# SVG Field Plugin for Craft CMS 5

A Craft CMS plugin that provides a custom field type for storing SVG content directly in the database.

## Who's it for?

It's for folks that need to inline SVG assets efficiently and resiliently, but aren't able to store the SVG files on the local filesystem.

This may be suitable if your site...

* Is load-balanced.
* Is running on ephemeral filesystems, which aren't guaranteed to persist.
* Takes a long time to request SVG files for the purposes of inlining them (e.g. they may be stored in a bucket many miles away).

## Features

- **Drag & Drop Upload**: Intuitive interface for uploading SVG files
- **Database Storage**: SVG content is stored as text in the database (not as files)
- **Live Preview**: See uploaded SVGs immediately in the admin interface
- **Content Management**: Remove or replace SVG content with built-in controls
- **Validation**: Ensures only valid SVG content is accepted
- **Template Ready**: Easy integration with Twig templates

## Installation

Install via composer:

```
composer require servd/svg-field
```

### Using the Field

1. **Upload**: Click the upload area or drag and drop an SVG file
